Step 1: Create an IAM Role for API Gateway

Before you create your API Gateway API, you need to give API Gateway permission to call Step Functions API actions.

##To set up permissions for API Gateway

1.Sign in to the IAM console and choose Roles, Create role.

2.On the Select type of trusted entity page, under AWS service, select API Gateway from the list, and then choose Next: Permissions.

3.On the Attached permissions policy page, choose Next: Tags.

4.On the Review page, enter APIGatewayToStepFunctions for Role name, and then choose Create role.

5.The IAM role appears in the list of roles.

6.Choose the name of your role and note the Role ARN, as shown in the following example.

arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/APIGatewayToStepFunctions

###To attach a policy to the IAM role

1.On the Roles page, search for your role (APIGatewayToStepFunctions), and then choose the role.

2.On the Permissions tab, choose Attach Policy.

3.On the Attach Policy page, search for AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess, choose the policy, and then choose Attach Policy.

Step 2: Create your API Gateway API
After you create your IAM role, you can create your custom API Gateway API.

##To create the API

1.Open the Amazon API Gateway console.

2.On the REST API pane, choose Build.

3.Choose New API.

4.In the Settings section, enter ManagerUserAccount for the API name, and then choose Create API.

##To create a resource

1. On the Resources page of ManagerUserAccount, choose Actions, Create Resource.

2.On the New Child Resource page, enter execution for Resource Name, and then choose Create Resource.

###To create a POST method

1.On the /execution Methods page, choose Actions, Create Method.

2.From the list, choose POST, and then select the check mark.


##To configure the integration point for your method

1.On the /execution - POST - Setup page, for Integration Type, choose AWS Service.

2.For AWS Region, choose a Region from the list.

3.For AWS Service, choose Step Functions from the list.

4.For HTTP Method, choose POST from the list.

5.For Action Type, choose Use action name.

6.For Action, enter StartExecution.

7.For Execution Role, enter the role ARN of the IAM role that you created earlier, as shown in the following example.

arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/APIGatewayToStepFunctions

8.Choose Save.

The visual mapping between API Gateway and Step Functions is displayed on the /execution - POST - Method Execution page.


Step 3: Test and Deploy the API Gateway API
Once you have created the API, test and deploy it.

To test the communication between API Gateway and Step Functions

On the /execution - POST - Method Execution page, choose Test.

On the /execution - POST - Method Test page, copy the following request parameters into the Request Body section using the ARN of an existing state machine. ARN of created state machine in last step

{
   "input": "{}",
   "name": "MyExecution",
   "stateMachineArn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:HelloWorld"
}
